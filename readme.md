[cosmicplayground.org](https://www.cosmicplayground.org)
is an educational hobby project exploring some tools and toys using web technology.
It's being developed in public with an open community and open source code.
Join us if you want to improve your webdev skills
with Svelte, SvelteKit, and TypeScript while making games in space!

- (work in progress) community at [cosmicplayground.dev](https://www.cosmicplayground.dev)
  ([source](https://github.com/cosmicplayground/community),
  [contributing.md](https://github.com/cosmicplayground/community/blob/main/contributing.md))
- There's a little action game on the home screen
  (still a work in progress, you'll know you've "beaten the game" when you can play sequences of music).
  to play, activate the starship `🛸` and try pressing the escape and backtick `\`` keys
  (needs better mobile controls, works with mouse+keyboard (and soon gamepads))
- [Soggy Planet](https://www.cosmicplayground.org/soggy-planet) is an interactive map of Earth
  where sea levels rise and fall and the lights of civilization shine through the night.
- [Starlit Hammock](https://www.cosmicplayground.org/starlit-hammock)
  invites you to sit back and soak in the staggering beauty of space
  as it slowly surveys the skies.
  Space out or zoom and pan around to explore on your own—try to spot your atoms' cousins!
  It displays images from Hubble, [spacetelescope.org](https://www.spacetelescope.org/about/).
  Try it on an idle screen but be mindful of the power usage. :]
  - it's not mobile friendly yet :|
  - Safari users: Starlit Hammock uses the modern image format webp instead of jpg,
    which means it only works on iOS 14 & macOS Big Sur or later
- Two tools for understanding
  [the easing functions in Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs#run-time-svelte-easing)
  (see also [the official example](https://svelte.dev/examples/easing)):
  - [Easing Function Visualizations](https://www.cosmicplayground.org/easings-1)
    compares all easings on a single screen
  - [Easing Function Visualizations and Auralizations](https://www.cosmicplayground.org/easings-2)
    focuses on one function at a time with bigger visuals and a tweakable audio representation
    ([auralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auralization))
- several odd and partially finished things, some of which require audio to make sense,
  and some might not work (or not well) on mobile

## develop

Everything is staticly hosted on GitHub pages,
and there's no 3rd party junk anywhere.

> **important**: Windows is not yet supported directly, but Windows users can use
> [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) and other VMs;
> see [this issue](https://github.com/cosmicplayground/cosmicplayground/issues/29) for more

To play with the code, you'll need Node 16.6+;

```bash
npm i
npm start # or gro dev
# open your browser to localhost:3000
npm run build # for production, or gro build
```
