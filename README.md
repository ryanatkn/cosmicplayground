[cosmicplayground.org](https://www.cosmicplayground.org)
is a collection of loosely related projects
that try to be useful or interesting in some way.
Here's what I got so far:

- [Deep Breath](https://www.cosmicplayground.org/#deep-breath),
  an interactive map of Earth with a rough answer to the question
  "if all ice on Earth melts, how will sea levels change?"
- several unfinished and/or weird things
  (warning: may induce ear discomfort or pain, OKAY??)
- an in-progress ear training game on the `earworm` branch
  that I theoretically want to continue making one day
