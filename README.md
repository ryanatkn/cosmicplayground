```

_[cosmicplayground.org](https://cosmicplayground.org)_
is a free, open source, experimental,
**work in progress** website exploring
_interactive information systems_ <sub>(??)</sub>
with over-engineered web tech.
It's currently steering towards abstract ideas like

- explorable systems
- creation and communication tools
- programmable interfaces
- generative creativity
- multiplayer interactivity

and so forth,
in domains like

- math
- dataviz
- web communication (web messaging in chats/forums, voting)
- training tools and skill building
- games and information tools (ear training, music theory, more)

using technology including

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [the Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

It aims to explore in many directions,
but the general goal
is to help us learn, create, communicate, and grow.
