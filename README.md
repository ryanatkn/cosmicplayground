```svelte
// work in progress
// current status: not much here but glimpses
```

_[cosmicplayground.org](https://cosmicplayground.org)_
is a free, open source, experimental,
**work in progress** website
currently steering towards abstract ideas like:

- explorable systems
- creation and communication tools
- programmable interfaces and editable environments
- generative creativity
- multiplayer interactivity
- collaborative information management
- personal data management
- accessible automated productivity
- training tools, skill building, and games -
  math, dataviz, audio/sound,
  music theory, ear training, weird audio/musical widgets, ...
- web communication: messaging in chats/forums, aggregation, voting, ...

using mostly open source technology including:

- [git](https://git-scm.com) and other forms of structured time travel
- cross-platform web
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
  - [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
  - [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
  - the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
  - many web libraries like [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org),
    [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
  - static cloud like [GitHub](https://github.com)

_cosmicplayground_ explores in many directions,
but the general goal
is to help us learn, create, communicate, and grow.
